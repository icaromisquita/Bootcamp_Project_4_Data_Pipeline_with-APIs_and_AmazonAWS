Data Pipeline using Amazon AWS to automate the data collection from API's to a MySQL local database.

There is a medium article explaining this project: https://medium.com/@Icaromisquita/a-data-engineer-project-with-mysql-python-and-aws-e58608a157cc

This project is a part of the DataScience Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. 

Project Status: Finished and correcting some bugs.
Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to learn dealing with API's and JSON files.
Data had to be requested, structured, and visualized. First a database is built in mySQL Workbench based on the data.
Then the scripts are transferred to the cloud (Amazon Web Services) and scheduled to be executed every 24 hours. Iteratively, an SQL database of weather and flight-information is built in the cloud.
