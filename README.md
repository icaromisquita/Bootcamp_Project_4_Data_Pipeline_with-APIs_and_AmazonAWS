âš™ WBS Project 4 Data Pipeline with API's and Amazon AWS

ðŸ”¹ Data Pipeline using Amazon AWS to automate the data collection from API's to a MySQL local database.

ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ There is a Medium article about this project at: https://medium.com/@Icaromisquita/a-data-engineer-project-with-mysql-python-and-aws-e58608a157cc


ðŸ”¸ Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to learn dealing with API's and JSON files.
Data had to be requested, structured, and visualized. First a database is built in mySQL Workbench based on the data.
Then the scripts are transferred to the cloud (Amazon Web Services) and scheduled to be executed every 24 hours. Iteratively, an SQL database of weather and flight-information is built in the cloud. </br>

ðŸ”¹ Methods Used
  * API-Calls
  * Data Engineering
  * Data Visualization
  * Cloud Computing
  * Cloud Database 

ðŸ”¹ Technologies
  * Python
    * Pandas
    * Jupyter Notebook
    * Requests (api)
    * Matplotlib
    * Amazon Webservices
   * SQL
   * Sqlalchemy

ðŸ”¸ Project Description

The data gathered is freely available:

  * Weather Data -> Open Weather.
  * Airport Data -> Rapid API
  * City Data -> datahub.io

ðŸ”¸ Main goals of the project:

  * Access weather and airport data via API-requests
  * Structure the incoming data to make it usable
  * Create some basic visualisations
  * Transfer the whole project to the cloud and schedule it for regular execution.
